     * 1. There is nothing that checks if the connection is valid on this call. This check should be done seperately.
     *      Even if a swap is executed where it appears that it is possible to execute the swap,
     *      these values should be read and a connection should be checked. (via this function).
     *      As you can underwrite the swap (where there is no connection) but when the swap arrives it
     *      does not fill the underwrite but instead fails on ack and releases the input on the source chain.
     *      You can use the similar function underwriteAndCheckConnection to also check the connection.
     *
     * 2. You are underwriting the specific instance of the transaction not the inclusion of the transaction.
     *      What this means for you, is that if the block of the transaction is lost/abandon/re-entered, then
     *      the underwriting will not be noted unless the transaction is re-executed almost EXACTLY as it was before.
     *      The most important parameter is U which is volatile and any change to the vault balances on the source chain
     *      will cause U to be different.
     *      In other words, if that transaction is re-executed before or after another swap which wasn't the case before
     *      then it won't fill the underwrite anymore and either be exeucted as an ordinary swap (to the user) or fail
     *      with an ack and release the original funds back to the user.
     *
     * 3. The execution of the underwrite is dependent on the correct execution of both
     *      the minout but also the additional logic. If either fails, then the swap is not
     *      underwritable. As a result, it is important that the underwrite is simulated before executed.
