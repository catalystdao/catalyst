/**
 * @title Catalyst: The Multi-Chain Swap pool
 * @author Catalyst Labs
 * @notice Catalyst multi-chain swap pool using the asset specific
 * pricing curve: W/w where W is an asset-specific weight and w
 * is the pool balance.
 *
 * The following contract supports between 1 and 3 assets for
 * atomic swaps. To increase the number of tokens supported,
 * change MAX_ASSETS to the desired maximum token amount.
 * This constant is set in "SwapPoolCommon.sol"
 *
 * The swappool implements the ERC20 specification, such that the
 * contract will be its own pool token.
 * @dev This contract is deployed inactive: It cannot be used as a
 * swap pool as is. To use it, a proxy contract duplicating the
 * logic of this contract needs to be deployed. In Vyper, this
 * can be done through (vy >=0.3.4) create_minimal_proxy_to.
 * In Solidity, this can be done through OZ clones: Clones.clone(...)
 * After deployment of the proxy, call setup(...). This will
 * initialize the pool and prepare it for cross-chain transactions.
 *
 * If connected to a supported cross-chain interface, call
 * setConnection to connect the pool with pools on other chains.
 *
 * Finally, call finishSetup to give up the deployer's control
 * over the pool. 
 * !If finishSetup is not called, the pool can be drained!
