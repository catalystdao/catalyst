/**
 * @title Catalyst: Common Swap Vault Logic
 * @author Catalyst Labs
 * @notice This abstract contract defines general logic of a Catalyst vault like:
 * - Vault Token through Solmate's ERC20 implementation.
 * - Connection management
 * - Security limit
 * - Swap Escrow
 *
 * By inheriting this abstract contract, a Vault automatically implements common swap vault logic.
 * @dev This contract uses the following special notation:
 * CAPITAL_LETTER_VARIABLES are constants or immutable.
 * _ prefixed varaibles are storage.
 * _ prefixed functions are internal.
 * Unless otherwise required, variables are exposed directly. Such that storage functions are
 * prefixed with _.
