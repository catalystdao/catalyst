/**
 * @title Catalyst: The Multi-Chain Swap pool
 * @author Catalyst Labs
 * @notice Catalyst multi-chain swap pool using the asset specific
 * pricing curve: W/(w 路 ln(2)) where W is an asset specific
 * weight and w is the pool balance.
 *
 * The following contract supports between 1 and 3 assets for
 * atomic swaps. To increase the number of tokens supported,
 * change NUMASSETS to the desired maximum token amount.
 *
 * Implements the ERC20 specification, such that the contract
 * will be its own pool token.
 * @dev This contract is deployed /broken/: It cannot be used as a
 * swap pool as is. To use it, a proxy contract duplicating the
 * logic of this contract needs to be deployed. In vyper, this
 * can be done through (vy 0.3.4) create_minimal_proxy_to.
 * After deployment of the proxy, call setup(...). This will
 * initialize the pool and prepare it for cross-chain transactions.
 *
 * If connected to a supported cross-chain interface, call
 * createConnection to connect the pool with pools on other chains.
 *
 * Finally, call finishSetup to give up the deployer's control
 * over the pool.
