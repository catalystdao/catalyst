/**
 * @title Catalyst: The Multi-Chain Vault
 * @author Cata Labs
 * @notice Catalyst multi-chain vault using the asset specific
 * pricing curve: W/w where W is an asset-specific weight and w
 * is the vault asset balance.
 *
 * The following contract supports between 1 and 3 assets for
 * atomic swaps. To increase the number of tokens supported,
 * change MAX_ASSETS to the desired maximum token amount.
 * This constant is set in "CatalystVaultCommon.sol"
 *
 * This vault implements the ERC20 specification, such that the
 * contract will be its own vault token.
 * @dev This contract is deployed inactive: It cannot be used as a
 * vault as is. To use it, a proxy contract duplicating the
 * logic of this contract needs to be deployed. In Vyper, this
 * can be done through (vy >= 0.3.4) create_minimal_proxy_to.
 * In Solidity, this can be done through OZ clones: Clones.clone(...)
 * After deployment of the proxy, call setup(...) AND initializeSwapCurves(...).
 * This will initialize the vault and prepare it for cross-chain transactions.
 * However, only the Catalyst factory is allowed to perform these functions.
 *
 * If connected to a supported cross-chain interface, call
 * setConnection to connect the vault with vaults on other chains.
 *
 * Finally, call finishSetup to give up the creators's control
 * over the vault. 
 * !If finishSetup is not called, the vault can be drained by the creators!
